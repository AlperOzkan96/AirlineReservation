A few assumptions:

1) When book a passenger to a flight, suppose that the passenger choose a random seat.

2) Suppose one passenger book the same flight at most once.
   For example, in inputfile2.txt "BookPassenger,MikeSmith,LAS,LAX" appears two times, 
   but we only book one tickt for MikeSmith for the flight "A124".
   But for "BookPassenger,KennethHarris,CHI,DFW", since there are two flights, and the first time
   KennethHarris pick "K792" which has the lower price, the second time KennethHarris pick "A792"
   They are two different flights, thus we book two tickets for KennethHarris.

3) Suppose when the following scenario happens:
   *The passenger booked a flight at price 100
   *The flight changed price to 80.
   *The passenger request to book the flight the second time.
   In this case, the passenger's flight price is still 100, unless it cancel the flight and book again.

3) Suppose we just consider just one type of passengers here.

4) Suppose we use single thread to handle the transaction.
